### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ArtRiv/ArtRiv** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal webapp project for a store
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning frontend techs such as React, Tailwind and Next.js
- ğŸ¤” If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or learning alongside me on my project, donâ€™t hesitate to reach me out on Discord .artart
